    <h1>A delicious Gaspacho recipe!</h1>
    <img src="../images/gazpacho.jpg">
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>About 2 pounds ripe red tomatoes, cored and roughly cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 Italian frying (cubanelle) pepper or another long, light green pepper, such as Anaheim, cored, seeded <br>
            and roughly cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 cucumber, about 8 inches long, peeled and roughly cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 small mild onion (white or red), peeled and roughly cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sherry vinegar, more to taste</li>
        <li>Salt to state</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, mre to taste, plus more for drizzling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tomatoes, pepper, cucumber, onion and garlic in a blender or, if using a hand blender, in a deep<br>
            bowl. (If necessary, work in batches.) Blend at high speed until very smooth, at least 2 minutes,
            pausing<br>
            occasionally to scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula.</li>
        <li>With the motor running, add the vinegar and 2 teaspoons salt. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil. The
            mixture<br>
            will turn bright orange or dark pink and become smooth and emulsified, like a salad dressing. If it
            still<br>
            seems watery, drizzle in more olive oil until texture is creamy.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture through a strainer or a food mill, pushing all the liquid through with a spatula or
            the<br>
            back of a ladle. Discard the solids. Transfer to a large pitcher (preferably glass) and chill until very<br>
            cold, at least 6 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Before serving, adjust the seasonings with salt and vinegar. If soup is very thick, stir in a few<br>
            tablespoons ice water. Serve in glasses, over ice if desired, or in a bowl. A few drops of olive oil on
            top<br>
            are a nice touch.</li>
    </ol>
