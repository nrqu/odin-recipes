            <strong>*Please note, this is my version of Paella Mixta I learned to make while living<br>
                in Madrid, Spain. I've simplified the recipe as best I could for anyone to be able to make<br>
                without a special pan or equipment. There are MANY variations to Paella so please be respectful<br>
                that my authentic recipe may be different from yours!</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Add olive oil to a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, bell peppers and garlic and cook<br>
            until onion is translucent. Add chopped tomato, bay leaf, paprika, saffron salt and pepper.<br>
            Stir and cook for 5 minutes. Add white wine and cook for 10 minutes. Taste and add salt if<br>
            needed.</li>
        <li>Add chicken pieces, 2 tablespoons chopped parsley and rice to the pot. Cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour the broth slowly all around the pan and jiggle the pan to get the rice into an even layer.<br> (Do not
            stir the mixture going forward!).</li>
        <li>Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low. Give the pan a gentle shake back and forth just once<br>
            or twice during cooking. (We don't ever stir the rice, so that a crispy crust forms at the bottom,
            called<br>
            a socarrat).</li>
        <li>Cook for about 15-18 minutes (uncovered), then nestle the shrimp, mussels and calamari into the mixture,<br>
            sprinkle peas on top and continue to cook (without stirring) for about 5 more minutes. Watch for most of
            the<br>
            liquid to be absorbed and the rice at the top nearly tender. (If for some reason your rice is still not<br>
            cooked, add ¼ cup more water or broth and continue cooking).</li>
        <li>Remove pan from heat and cover pan with a lid or tinfoil. Place a kitchen towel over the lid and allow
            to<br>
            rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon slices. Serve.</li>
